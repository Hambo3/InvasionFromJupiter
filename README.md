# Development
I had always wanted to do a side scrolling shooter with enormous end of level bosses and so I used this competition as the ideal opportunity, especially as the theme was Space.  
I had the idea to have these giant end of level bosses that where bigger than the screen and you would zoom out to fit it in. Thought it might look cool with tiny ships battling this massive boss ship.  
I had developed an engine to support this already that handled all the zoom and scrolling mechanics so this was an opportunity to use that.  
My first game using javascript classes also which made a huge difference in bringing down the file size required for such a competition.
